# Detecting disease-based alterations in the human protein association network using publicly available network.

This repository contain all code necessary to detect novel disease-associated proteins. The code has been written using Python version 3.8.3 and requires the implementation of the Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and NetworkX packages.
The first map of this repository contains the code used to collect and filter all data.
The second map focusses on different algorithms that were tested to obtain the best suitable computational model for this research.
The third map contains all code used to obtain the optimal parameters for the model,
and maps 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 focus on applying the computational model on a breast carcinoma-, schizophrenia- and intellectual disability based network, respectively.
